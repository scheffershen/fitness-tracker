# Research: Fitness Tracker Application

## Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: AsyncStorage with local-first approach and JSON serialization
**Rationale**:
- Offline-first requirement necessitates local storage
- AsyncStorage is React Native standard for key-value persistence
- JSON format allows complex workout data structures
- Future cloud sync can be added via background sync patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite: More complex setup, overkill for initial MVP
- Realm: Additional dependency, learning curve
- Cloud-only: Violates offline requirement

## Exercise Database Management

**Decision**: Static JSON database with categorization hierarchy
**Rationale**:
- 500+ exercises require structured categorization
- Static approach ensures consistent data across installations
- JSON format allows easy filtering and searching
- Categories by muscle group, equipment type, and movement pattern
**Alternatives considered**:
- API-based: Requires network, violates offline requirement
- User-generated: Complex UX, data quality issues
- Third-party fitness APIs: External dependencies, cost implications

## State Management Architecture

**Decision**: Zustand for global state with AsyncStorage persistence
**Rationale**:
- Already established in VibeCoded project
- Lightweight alternative to Redux
- Built-in persistence middleware available
- TypeScript support aligns with constitution requirements
**Alternatives considered**:
- React Context: Performance issues with frequent updates
- Redux Toolkit: Overly complex for fitness tracking use case
- Local component state: Insufficient for cross-screen data sharing

## Navigation and Screen Structure

**Decision**: Expo Router file-based routing with nested layouts
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing VibeCoded architecture
- Tab-based navigation for main sections (Workout, History, Progress)
- Stack navigation for detailed views
- Platform-appropriate navigation patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- React Navigation standalone: Adds complexity vs. Expo Router
- Single-page approach: Poor UX for multi-section app

## Performance Optimization Strategies

**Decision**: FlatList virtualization with memoized components
**Rationale**:
- Large exercise lists require efficient rendering
- React.memo for exercise cards prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading for exercise details and images
- Native performance maintained across platforms
**Alternatives considered**:
- ScrollView: Memory issues with large datasets
- Third-party list libraries: Additional dependencies

## Testing Strategy Alignment

**Decision**: Jest + React Native Testing Library + Detox E2E
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for comprehensive testing
- Unit tests for business logic (workout calculations, validations)
- Component tests for UI interactions
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
**Alternatives considered**:
- Testing Library only: Insufficient for E2E scenarios
- Manual testing only: Violates constitutional TDD requirement

## Offline Data Sync Strategy

**Decision**: Local-first with eventual cloud sync capability
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional offline requirement
- User data always available without network
- Conflict resolution via "last writer wins" for MVP
- Background sync when network available
**Alternatives considered**:
- Online-only: Violates offline requirements
- Complex CRDT: Overkill for personal fitness data
- Manual sync: Poor user experience
