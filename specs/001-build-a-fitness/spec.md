## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A fitness enthusiast opens the app to log their daily workout. They start a new workout session, browse through categorized exercises (by muscle group and equipment), select their desired exercises, and record multiple sets with repetitions and weight for each exercise. After completing their workout, they can view their workout history and track their progress over time to monitor consistency and improvement.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the main screen, **When** they start a new workout, **Then** they can add exercises from a categorized list
2. **Given** the user has selected an exercise, **When** they add sets with reps and weight, **Then** the data is recorded for that exercise
3. **Given** the user has completed workouts, **When** they view workout history, **Then** they see a chronological list of previous workouts
4. **Given** the user wants to track progress, **When** they view progress screen, **Then** they see visual data about their consistency and performance improvements
5. **Given** the user is browsing exercises, **When** they filter by muscle group or equipment, **Then** only relevant exercises are displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user starts a workout but doesn't complete it?
- How does the system handle invalid weight or repetition entries (negative numbers, non-numeric values)?
- What happens when the user tries to add the same exercise multiple times in one workout?
- How does progress tracking work when the user has irregular workout patterns?
